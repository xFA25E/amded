Interface to music tagging application [[https://github.com/ft/amded][amded]]

This package allows music files to be easily tagged in a convenient widget
buffer using amded program.

* Usage

Open Dired buffer, put cursor on music files (or mark them) and run ~amded~.  A
new buffer with widgets should pop-up.

For now, only Dired and Mpc modes are supported, but amded can be easily
extended using ~amded-files-functions~.  Just provide a function which returns a
list of absolute file-names and amded will take care of the rest.

** Tips
+ The user is encouraged to customize ~amded-editable-tags~.  Amded can set a
  lot of tags, but, almost certainly, you don't care about most of them.

*** Bulk editing

+ ~amded-set~ sets the same value for a tag in every widget.

+ ~amded-set-incremental-number~ takes a numeric tag
  (~amded-editable-numeric-tags~) and a number to start from.  It sets the tag
  value in every widget incrementing it.  Used for setting track numbers.

+ ~amded-set-from-template~ to set tags from ~amded-template-regexp~.  Tag
  values are taken from numeric groups of regexp.  You can customize it, of
  course.  See its docstring.  If you need to support other tags in template,
  you can customize ~amded-template-regexp-groups~.
