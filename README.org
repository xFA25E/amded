buffer using amded program.

* Installation
** Nix
This repo is a nix flake.  You can just add ~overlays.default~ output to your
nixpkgs overlays.

#+begin_src nix
{
  inputs.amded.url = "github:xFA25E/amded";
  outputs = { self, amded, nixpkgs }: let
    pkgs = import nixpkgs {
      system = "your-system";
      overlays = [ amded.overlays.default ];
    };
  in {
    # YOUR OUTPUTS
  };
}
#+end_src

** Package manager
If you've installed it with your package manager, you're done.  ~amded~ is
autoloaded, so you can call it right away.

** Manual
Put /amded.el/ in your load-path, and put the following in your init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(require 'amded)
#+END_SRC

* Usage

Open Dired buffer, put cursor on music files (or mark them) and run ~amded~.  A
new buffer with widgets should pop-up.

For now, only Dired modes are supported, but amded can be easily extended using
~amded-files-functions~.  Just provide a function which returns a list of
absolute file-names and amded will take care of the rest.

** Tips
+ The user is encouraged to customize ~amded-editable-tags~.  Amded can set a
  lot of tags, but, almost certainly, you don't care about most of them.

*** Bulk editing

+ ~amded-set~ sets the same value for a tag in every widget.

+ ~amded-numeric-set~ takes a numeric tag (~amded-editable-numeric-tags~) and a
  number to start from.  It sets the tag value in every widget incrementing it.
